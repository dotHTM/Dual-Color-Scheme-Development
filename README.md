# MD LD

A Convience Syntax family that "extend" the built in MultiMarkdown syntax, so a UI Color Theme Developer can view both the light and dark varients of their theme.

# How it works:

1. Install this syntax package.

2. Write a test file, link it into it's complementary extention, one "light", one "dark". which doesn't matter).

3. Open your theme source file(s) in one pane, then the two sample files in two others. **View** > **Layout** > **3 Pane Third Right** is a great starter layout.

4. For each of the sample files, use the **syntax specific settings** to set the appropriate color scheme you want to preview.
